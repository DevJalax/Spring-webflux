Differences between Spring MVC [traditional] vs Spring Webflux

1. Programming Model
Spring MVC: Synchronous, blocking model based on the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
Spring WebFlux: Asynchronous, non-blocking model based on reactive programming principles.

2. Thread Management
Spring MVC: Each request is handled by a dedicated thread from a thread pool, leading to potential thread blocking during I/O operations.
Spring WebFlux: Uses a small number of threads to handle many concurrent requests, avoiding blocking by using reactive streams.

3. Transaction Management
Spring MVC: Uses @Transactional for synchronous transaction management with traditional transaction managers (JDBC, JPA, Hibernate).
Spring WebFlux: Provides reactive transaction management through ReactiveTransactionManager and supports non-blocking transactions.

4. Data Access
Spring MVC: Typically uses synchronous data access technologies (JDBC, JPA, Hibernate) with blocking operations.
Spring WebFlux: Supports reactive data access technologies (R2DBC, reactive MongoDB) with non-blocking operations returning Mono or Flux.

5. Server Environment
Spring MVC: Built on the Servlet API and runs on traditional servlet containers (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.).
Spring WebFlux: Can run on traditional servlet containers but is optimized for reactive servers like Netty.

6. Routing and Handlers
Spring MVC: Uses @Controller and @RequestMapping annotations to define request handling methods.
Spring WebFlux: Supports both annotated and functional routing (using RouterFunction and HandlerFunction).

7. Response Types
Spring MVC: Returns standard Java objects or ResponseEntity for synchronous responses.
Spring WebFlux: Returns reactive types (Mono for 0 or 1 element, Flux for 0 to N elements) for asynchronous responses.

8. Error Handling
Spring MVC: Uses traditional exception handling mechanisms (e.g., @ExceptionHandler, @ControllerAdvice).
Spring WebFlux: Provides reactive error handling using onErrorResume, onErrorReturn, and similar operators in the reactive stream.

9. Testing
Spring MVC: Uses MockMvc for testing controllers in isolation with synchronous requests.
Spring WebFlux: Uses WebTestClient for testing controllers with asynchronous requests and reactive types.

10. Performance and Scalability
Spring MVC: Generally performs well under moderate load but can struggle with high concurrency due to blocking I/O.
Spring WebFlux: Designed for high concurrency and low latency, efficiently handling many simultaneous connections.

11. Use Cases
Spring MVC: Best suited for traditional web applications and RESTful services where synchronous processing is acceptable.
Spring WebFlux: Ideal for applications requiring high concurrency, real-time processing, or streaming data.

12. Learning Curve
Spring MVC: Easier for developers familiar with traditional synchronous programming models.
Spring WebFlux: Requires a shift in mindset towards reactive programming, which may introduce additional complexity.

13. Integration with Reactive Streams
Spring MVC: Does not natively support reactive streams; typically relies on blocking I/O.
Spring WebFlux: Fully integrates with Project Reactor, allowing for the use of reactive streams throughout the application.

14. Support for WebSockets
Spring MVC: Limited support for WebSockets, primarily through traditional servlet-based mechanisms.
Spring WebFlux: Provides first-class support for WebSockets, allowing for reactive handling of WebSocket connections.

15. Configuration
Spring MVC: Configuration is typically done via XML or Java-based configuration classes.
Spring WebFlux: Configuration can be more programmatic, especially when using functional routing.

| Feature                     | JDBC                                   | R2DBC                                   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **I/O Model**               | Blocking, synchronous                  | Non-blocking, asynchronous              |
| **Connection Management**    | Uses connection pooling libraries like HikariCP | Supports reactive connection pooling with `r2dbc-pool` |
| **Thread Management**        | Dedicated threads for each request, can lead to thread exhaustion | Uses fewer threads, handles requests reactively |
| **Repository Support**       | Requires manual implementation of repository interfaces | Spring Data R2DBC provides reactive repository support out-of-the-box |
| **Query Definition**         | Uses `@Query` annotation for custom queries | Supports `@Query` annotated methods for custom queries |
| **Reactive Types**           | Returns standard Java types            | Returns reactive types like `Mono` and `Flux` |
| **Configuration**            | Requires explicit configuration for connection pooling | Easier configuration with reactive support |
| **Performance**              | Can lead to bottlenecks under high load | Better scalability and resource utilization |
